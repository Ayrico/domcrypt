DOMCrypt

DOMCrypt is a Firefox extension that adds 'window.mozCipher' javascript object to any webpage.

REQUIRES Firefox 4 or nightly: http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/ or http://nightly.mozilla.org

All of the underlying encryption is handled by NSS, so it is fast native code

window.mozCipher exposes a Public Key Crypto API to content:

window.mozCipher.pk.generateKeyPair(); - which accepts and stores a passphrase via chrome-privileged password prompts. All of the user encryption credentials are stored on the filesystem inaccessible to content (or web page) Javascript.

window.mozCipher.pk.encrypt();

window.mozCipher.pk.decrypt();

window.mozCipher.pk.decrypt();

window.mozCipher.pk.getPublicKey();

See demo.html and demo.js for actual usage. 

BETTER YET, use it live: http://mozilla.ddahl.com/domcrypt/demos/demo.html

DOMCrypt is an effort to prototype what an easy to use DOM API for public key encryption looks like. This should be as much a part of 'HTML 5' as <audio> or <video>, etc.
