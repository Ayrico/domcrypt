DOMCrypt

DOMCrypt is a Firefox extension that adds 'window.crypt' javascript object to any webpage.

All of the underlying encryption is handled by NSS, so it is fast native code

window.crypt exposes a Public Key Crypto API to content:

window.crypt.generateKeyPair("aPassphrase");

window.crypt.encrypt(aMessage, aPublicKey);

window.crypt.decrypt(aMessage, aPublicKey, aCryptoObject);
  (aCryptoObj is an object literal with the properties: privKey, passphrase, aSalt, aIV)

See demo.html and demo.js for actual usage.
