DOMCrypt

DOMCrypt is a Firefox extension that adds 'window.crypt' javascript object to any webpage.

REQUIRES Firefox 4 beta or nightly: http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/ or http://nightly.mozilla.org


All of the underlying encryption is handled by NSS, so it is fast native code

window.crypt exposes a Public Key Crypto API to content:

window.crypt.generateKeyPair("aPassphrase");

window.crypt.encrypt(aMessage, aPublicKey);

window.crypt.decrypt(aMessage, aPublicKey, aCryptoObject);
  (aCryptoObj is an object literal with the properties: privKey, passphrase, aSalt, aIV)

See demo.html and demo.js for actual usage. 

BETTER YET, use it live: http://mozilla.ddahl.com/domcrypt/demo.html

DOMCrypt is an effort to try and formulate what an easy to use DOM API for public key encryption looks like. This should be as much a part of 'HTML 5' as <audio> or <video>, etc.
